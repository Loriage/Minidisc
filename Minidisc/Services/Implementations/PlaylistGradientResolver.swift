/// by the edit flow (re-pick) and the empty→first-track transition. Cross-platform.
///
/// - `firstTrackCoverArtId == nil` (empty playlist) → the neutral default spec.
/// - otherwise → the first track cover's dominant color (averaged OFF-MAIN so a resolve never hitches the
///   UI), memoized via `DominantColorExtractor`.
///
/// Callers FREEZE the result into `PlaylistCoverChoice`; this is never re-run on reorder/remove/track-1
/// change — only on an explicit re-pick or the one-time empty→first-track transition.
