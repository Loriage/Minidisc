/// Asks iOS to keep the app running while a long piece of work finishes after the user leaves.

/// Minidisc declares the `audio` background mode, so ANY work runs freely while music plays — which
/// covers Instant Mix, since the seed track starts before the mix is built. The gap is work started
/// with nothing playing: browsing, then backgrounding. Without an assertion the app is suspended
/// within a few seconds and the work simply freezes mid-flight.
///
/// What this buys is a grace period, roughly half a minute — not unlimited time. Anything longer
/// still has to survive being interrupted, which is why the mood sync records its progress per mood
/// rather than per run.
