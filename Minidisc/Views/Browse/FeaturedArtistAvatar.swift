/// The round avatar for a "Featured Artist" cell. Shows the album cover (which we already have from the
/// track) immediately, then swaps to the real ARTIST PHOTO once it's resolved and confirmed loadable —
/// progressively, with no placeholder flash (CoverArtView keeps the prior image until the new one resolves,
/// and we pre-load the photo so the swap is a RAM hit).
///
/// Resolution is **Path A, zero per-artist fetch**: the artist's cover-art id comes from the shared
/// `LibraryService` artist-name index (`findArtist(byName:)`, built once from `getArtists`), then the bytes
/// load through the existing `artworkImageCache`. If the artist isn't found (offline / name mismatch / id
/// collision) or has no photo, the album cover stays — never a placeholder. Cross-platform.
